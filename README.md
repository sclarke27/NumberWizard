# NumberWizard
Simple number guessing game created in Unity 4.6 as part of Udemy.com course. Using lessons learned from sections 1, 3, and 4 this version of NumberWizard uses boolean member variables to allow the player to pick up and drop items inside the prison cell. Doing this alter the description of the cell and things in it. This version also has a simple menu system so the player isnt dropped right into the main text and so the player can exit the game.
